  Problem Set #2

    Employed to hide instantiation of Pyramid classes from main,
  this class creates and returns a specified Pyramid object to
  the calling code. As of v0.4 (pset4), it is coded as a
  Singleton class.

    Note: Since, at this point in the Mario application's
  development, there is only one intended function for the
  Pyramid class, the case could be made that this file serves
  no practical purpose beyond Factory Design demonstration.
    For a better example, see "PrintFactory.java".
